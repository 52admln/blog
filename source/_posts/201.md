歌词：
Cause you're a sky cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
Cause you're a sky cause you're a sky full of stars
Cause you light up the path

And I don't care go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

Cause you're a sky cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms
Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

And I don't care go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you – I think I see you

Cause in a sky cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you – I think I see you

Cause you're a sky you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view – You're such a heavenly view
